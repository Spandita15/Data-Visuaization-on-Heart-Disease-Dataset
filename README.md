## Data Visualization using Python libraries
<p>Data visualization is a powerful tool for understanding and communicating insights from a dataset. It can help you to identify patterns, trends, and relationships in your data, and can be a useful way to communicate your findings to others. Some common types of visualizations for exploring a heart disease dataset include scatter plots, line plots, bar plots, and histograms.</p>
